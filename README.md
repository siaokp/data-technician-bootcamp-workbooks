#  Data Technician Bootcamp – Learning Journey (Weeks 1–6)

This repository documents my full learning journey through a **Data Technician Skills Bootcamp**, covering **Weeks 1–6** of structured training, practical exercises, and applied technical work.

The repository is organised chronologically and reflects both **technical skill development** and **professional progression**, moving from foundational digital skills through to Python-based data analysis and visualisation.

##  Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific bootcamp week and contains the associated:
- Workbooks
- Exercises
- Scripts
- Outputs
- Notes and reflections (where applicable)

Week 1/
Week 2/
Week 3/
Week 5/
Week 6/


>  **Note:** There is intentionally no Week 4 workbook.  
> Week 4 was dedicated to **careers, employability, and professional development**, rather than technical workbook-based tasks.
